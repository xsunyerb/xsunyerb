## Hello

My name is Xavier, I'm from Spain. I am working professionally in software engineering since 2008.

## Skills

- My favorite programming languages are C# and C++, although I worked in other languages, such as JavaScript and PHP, and also used various frameworks and libraries, as .NET, React, React Native, Vue.js and Windows Presentation Foundation.

- I worked in desktop, mobile, and web applications, as well in creating REST APIs.

- I like DevOps culture, and the idea of increasing the collaboration between the roles of development and operations.

- In recent years, I worked in cloud architecture, mainly Azure. I like to create CI/CD pipelines in Github and Azure DevOps, and use Terraform to create infrastructure as code.
